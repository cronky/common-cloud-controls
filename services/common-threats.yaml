    title: Attacker modifies access control settings to expose or deny data
    description: Aaccess control policies such as IAM roles and access policies can be misconfigured to grant excessive privileges. An attacker or misinformed user can alter these policies, unintentionally or maliciously, to allow unauthorized access to sensitive data.

    title: Attacker grants bucket access to untrusted principals
    description: The bucket access controls (e.g. ACLs, bucket policies) can enable access to objects owned by the bucket. An attacker (or someone by negligence) can change (i.e., impair) the bucket access controls and make the content accessible to untrusted principals (via public endpoints, cross-account VPC endpoints, or cross-account access point).

    title: Vendor-hosted keys are compromised
    description: The service uses a vendor-hosted key management service (KMS) to manage encryption keys. Insider threats or mistakes can result in access by a threat actor.

    title: Attacker intercepts data in transit
    description: The service allows unencrypted communication (e.g., HTTP). An attacker can intercept traffic between clients and the service to read or modify the data during transmission.

    title: Attacker encrypts data with client-managed keys
    description: The service provides encryption mechanisms, but the encryption keys are managed by the client. An attacker with access to the service can encrypt the data, rendering it inaccessible without the decryption key they hold. Additionally, an attacker may alter the encryption key management settings to prevent access to data.
